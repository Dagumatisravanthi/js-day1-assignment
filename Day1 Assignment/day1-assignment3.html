 <body>
  <p>In JavaScript there are two different kinds of data: primitives, and objects. A primitive is simply a data type that is not an object, and has no methods.</p>
<p>In JS, there are six primitive data types:</P>
Boolean<br>
Number<br>
String<br>
Null<br>
Undefined<br>
Symbol<br>
</font size="4" color="blue">Boolean:</font>
<p>A boolean represents only one of two values: true, or false. Think of a boolean as an on/off or a yes/no switch.</p>
Ex:<br>
var boo1 = true;
var boo2 = false;<br>
</font size="4" color="blue">Number:</font>
<p>There is only one type of Number in JavaScript. Numbers can be written with or without a decimal point. A number can also be +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (not a number).</p>
Ex:<br>
var num1 = 32;
var num2 = +Infinity;<br>
</font size="4" color="blue">String:</font>
<p>Strings are used for storing text. Strings must be inside of either double or single quotes. In JS, Strings are immutable (they cannot be changed).</p>
Ex:<br>
var str1 = 'hello, it is me';
var str2 = "hello, it's me";<br>
</font size="4" color="blue">Null:</font>
<p>Null has one value: null. It is explicitly nothing.</p>
Ex:<br>
var nothing = null;<br>
</font size="4" color="blue">Undefined:</font>
<p>In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.</p>
Ex:<br>
var testVar;
console.log(testVar); // undefined<br>
</font size="4" color="blue">Symbol:</font>
<p>Symbols are new in ES6. A Symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique. For the sake of brevity, that is the extent that this article will cover Symbols.</p>
Ex:<br>
const mySymbol = Symbol('mySymbol');<br>
<font size="5" color="violet">Objects</font>
<p>Objects are not a primitive data Type.</p>
<font size="4" color="blue">Objects</font>
<p>An object is a collection of properties. These properties are stored in key/value pairs. Properties can reference any type of data, including objects and/or primitive values.</p>
Ex:<br>
var obj = {
  key1: 'value',
  key2: 'value',
  key3: true,
  key4: 32,
  key5: {}
}<br>
<font size="4" color="blue">JavaScript Arrays:</font>
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
Array items are separated by commas.
The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):
Example:<br>
var cars = ["Saab","Volvo","BMW"];
